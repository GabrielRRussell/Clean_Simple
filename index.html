		<h1>Clean and Simple Thoughts</h1>
		<p>When you have clean and simple thoughts, clean and simple things come about. Take a look around my portfolio, and relax.</p>
		<p>There are a couple things I'll have on here. For one, my github repository. While I still don't know how to use Github in a way that doesn't have me ripping my hair out every day, it's useful and holds other neat stuff. Also on here, I have a couple wallpapers I had designed over the course of this semester. You can check that over at the "Illustrator" page. I made a website as my project for the Web Design class about 3DS Homebrew, you can check that out over at the Homebrew Project link. My github repo is also listed at the top. Below I'll have some simple rambles and talks of mine.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Homebrew, a pasttime of mine</h3>
		<p>With recent developments into the spritetools software, it has been easier than ever to get into Homebrew development for the 3DS. I've considered learning Lua LovePotion+ for the hobby, but it seemed a tad much. I'm not really a fan of Lua. The problem with development is that it is all standard C/++. The choice of language is really strained as the platform hasn't been developed. Java isn't an option. Python has a <i>very</i> limited interpreter that hasn't been updated in months. Lua is developed, but is such an oddball many devs cannot use due to limitations with it. Since I've had to go with C, which isn't something I'm very comfortable with, learning it is really just needed. I've spent time into it, but as I've found with every other project, it's a better idea to just head into something face first, without the regular stress of learning something and imposing limits on yourself. Going about things and experimenting is a strong way of learning anything, and that was how I got into this type of business.</p>
		
		<p>Spritetools is a library designed to make development much easier than with the standard CTRULIB library. And while things are still a little bit difficult, it makes it way easier, and has debug tools. Combined with the Citra emulator, I can develop software right from my laptop, a great combination that leads to easy testing. I have a pretty standard setup. I use Programmers Notepad to view my code, with no other real software. I usually have Windows Explorer to view directories when I need to, and I have CMD open, just when I need to use MAKE. It may sound complex, but its actually rather simple. Probably my least favorite part would be setting up MAKEFILES, as they can get a little annoying from time to time. But they're designed to make life much easier, and they really do.</p>
		
		<p>If I had to be honest, using the actual hardware is kind of annoying. The way the my network is setup, I cannot run Netloader. Netloader is a piece of software designed to allow you to send an executable over the network to your 3DS for the HBL. It is much slower than actually using an executable on the SD card, but it's great for when you don't want to take out the SD card (For clarity, on the latest model the SD card slot is in the back, behind a panel which you have to unscrew, making it annoying to take it out). Usually, I'll end up just FTPing the file to my 3DS using FTPDb and FileZilla, to avoid taking out the back panel. Once I have the file on the SD card, I'll usually just activate another payload, and use the application.</p>
		
		<p>One option I could use to avoid launching any type of payload to use my application is MakeROM. MakeROM is a piece of development software that much like devKitProARM, builds 3DS software. The only major difference between the two is that this builds the homebrew in a CIA format, which means you can use it to install to the homescreen.</p>
		
		<p class = "secret">Technically MakeRom uses the DevKit Compiler, but it's a different process.</p>
