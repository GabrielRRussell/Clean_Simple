		<h1>Clean and Simple Thoughts</h1>
		<h3>Front Page Rambles</h3>
		<p>When you have clean and simple thoughts, clean and simple things come about. Take a look around my portfolio, and relax. If relaxing isn't your thing, I have hidden 5 keys around my website. They can only be revealed by hovering over them, and they are hidden in the text. Have fun! They will turn white when hovered over, and look like this: <span class = "key">F</span> <br>Don't worry about finding them all. if you read the content on the page, you'll find them. Hints are scattered throughout the website. For your first hint, go down the page, and look for the word "MAKEFILE". Your first key, lies there.</p>
		<p>There are a couple things I'll have on here. <span class = "key">F</span>or one, my github repository. While I still don't know how to use Github in a way that doesn't have me ripping my hair out every day, it's useful and holds other neat stuff. Also on here, I have a couple wallpapers I had designed over the course of this semester. You can check that over at the "Illustrator" page. I made a website as my project for the Web Design class about 3DS Homebrew, you can check that out over at the Homebrew Project link. My github repo is also listed at the top. Below I'll have some simple rambles and talks of mine.</p>

		<h3>Homebrew, a pasttime of mine</h3>
		<p>With recent developments into the spritetools software, it has been easier than ever to get into Homebrew development for the 3DS. I've considered learning Lua LovePotion+ for the hobby, but it seemed a tad much. I'm not really a fan of Lua. The problem with development is that it is all standard C/++. The choice of language is really strained as the platform hasn't been developed. Java isn't an option. Python has a <i>very</i> limited interpreter that hasn't been updated in months. Lua is developed, but is such an oddball many devs cannot use due to limitations with it. Since I've had to go with C, which isn't something I'm very comfortable with, learning it is really just needed. I've spent time into it, but as I've found with every other project, it's a better idea to just head into something face first, without the regular stress of learning something and imposing limits on yourself. Going about things and experimenting is a strong way of learning anything, and that was how I got into this type of business. (By the way, if you're playing the key game, look in the paragraphs above. I think it was something about my repository...)</p>
		
		<p>Spritetools is a library designed to make development much easier than with the standard CTRULIB library. And while things are still a little bit difficult, it makes it way easier, and has debug tools. Combined with the Citra emulator, I can develop software right from my laptop, a great combination that leads to easy testing. I have a pretty standard setup. I use Programmers Notepad to view my code, with no other real software. I usually have Windows Explorer to view directories when I need to, and I have CMD open, just when I need to use MAKE. It may sound complex, but its actually rather simple. Probably my least favorite part would be setting up MAKE<span class = "key">F</span>ILES, as they can get a little annoying from time to time. But they're designed to make life much easier, and they really do.</p>
		
		<p>If I had to be honest, using the actual hardware is kind of annoying. The way the my network is setup, I cannot run Netloader. Netloader is a piece of software designed to allow you to send an executable over the network to your 3DS for the HBL. It is much slower than actually using an executable on the SD card, but it's great for when you don't want to take out the SD card (For clarity, on the latest model the SD card slot is in the back, behind a panel which you have to unscrew, making it annoying to take it out). Usually, I'll end up just FTPing the file to my 3DS using FTPDb and FileZilla, to avoid taking out the back panel. Once I have the file on the SD card, I'll usually just activate another payload, and use the application.</p>
		
		<p>One option I could use to avoid launching any type of payload to use my application is MakeROM. MakeROM is a piece of development software that much like devKitProARM, builds 3DS software. The only major difference between the two is that this builds the homebrew in a CIA format, which means you can use it to install to the homescreen.</p>
		
		<p class = "secret">Technically MakeRom uses the DevKit Compiler, but it's a different process.</p>

		<h3>Game Development</h3>
		<p>Game development is something I've been wanting to get into recently, but it is hard. I've had ideas, concepts, prototypes, and went through multiple engines and languages, but nothing really seems to fit. The reason I like homebrew so much is that it is one simple development and testing environment. Like the old addage, "It works on my machine", if it works on the dev unit, it will work on the consumer unit. Plus, with such a variety of features, it seems to really have a lot of things that I'd like to use. One of the little things that I'm working on is a little platformer game. It features a little guy called Craig. He jumps, and that's about it. Not much there. It's all terminal, meaning that everything is drawn out using text, with text positions modified by the values. There isn't too much to it so far, but I'm still working on it. I want to move to spritesheets, but I cannot wrap my head around the process. There is literally about a billion different combinations and functions to use, so it will take me a while to figure out. After that, I'll make the jump, revamp art, and maybe add some other aspects. This won't really be a test of what I can make, it will just be a fun little project I can make. I have made some other games in the past though, and they have done okay... Actually I really want to delete them, but I forgot the password to where I hosted those horrible pieces of software many years I ago, so there is quite literally no way for me to get rid of it. Old, un-optimised games that while they did well, they just weren't... Good. Experiment really just meant graveyard of code for me a couple years ago. (Hey! You made it to the end! Your reward is... A key! Go to the links page, it'll be there.)</p>
