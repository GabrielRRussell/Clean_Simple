		<h3>Earthbound - Mechanics of Game Design</h3>
		<p>Most video games in the industry have some type of core mechanic, in which they rely on. Indie games in particular mostly rely on one major mechanic to make their game stand out from the crowd. Earthbound is a game for the SNES, released in August 27th, 1994, that doesn't really take this concept to heart. Like many other games, it doesn't rely on a few core mechanics, instead it relies on creating an atmosphere that cannot be broken easily.</p>
		<p>The game itself has an atmosphere where the game feels like a living person at times. Tons of little things come together to create an experience that really sets it apart from other games of its time. Most RPG's at the time were in a Fantasy Setting, so something more <i>realistic</i> (take this with a grain of salt please), set up a challenge.</p>
		<p>Some things can be extremely different departures. One of which is how food works. In most games, healing or applying First Aid is pretty simple. Select an item that repairs your broken and torn body, and it heals you for the amount given. In Earthbound, the amounts are instead rough estimates, with the player sometimes getting a sandwich that wasn't quite as satisfying, or maybe the most delicious Hot Dog you've seen in years. Another part of this is condiments. Later in the game, when you reach Fourside, you meet a merchant who sells condiments. You can apply these to foods to amplify how well they heal you. For example, you can put ketchup on a Hot Dog, which makes it heal you more. But it also has another piece. Remember how I said it has an atmospheric side to the game? Would you put salt on a Hot Dog? I doubt it, and it seems that Ness doesn't enjoy that much either. Applying a bad condiment to foods can make them heal less.</p>
		<p>Gameplay wise, the battles are fun. And they share some really interesting mechanics that you don't tend to see anywhere else. In most games, you have a very clearly defined limit. Get hit this amount of times, Game Over. Jump into this pit, Game Over. If your partner dies, Game Over. But in Earthbounds battles, the health is not a bar or number. When you play a game like The Witcher, getting stabbed 8 times will probably kill you, without anyway to save yourself. In Earthbound, the game notifies you whenever you get Mortally Wounded. The health is actually a scrolling number, meaning that it constantly goes down when you subtract from it. So when mortally wounded, this makes it possible to save yourself. If you have enough health, and you're hurt badly, you can just heal yourself, or eat some food. This incentivises the player to act quickly. If they act quickly, they may be able to perform things they wouldn't if they took their time. This means that despite a turn based formula, battles are rather fast paced and action filled. Every opportunity to fight is filled with Worry, Happiness, and Desperation.</p>
		<p>Imagine being literally set on fire. It would be horrible! But when it comes to games, you don't worry about that much. When a Pokemon gets burned, it isn't something you stress too badly about. It only gets hurt a little bit over time. Not bad. In Earthbound, you have some typically status effects, but for the most part they seem more human than in other games. You can empathise with Ness when he gets homesick. It's something everybody understands, and you would feel bad if that happened to someone you knew. The way you get rid of this little piece of text, which you somehow feel for, you can't just use an item or heal up to get rid of. Ness will stop in battle to think about his Mom, or will constantly miss his hits. The only way to get rid of it, is to visit home, or to call home. </p>
		<p>The game was entirely written by one person, and it's good writing. The entire game feels like it's just alive, with witty conversation coming from each and every person. Part of what makes Earthbound so great, is how alive it is, and how it makes you sympathize with its characters. That isn't something you really see in other games nowadays. The writing is skipped in favor of strong mechanics, which while I don't mind, it really kills the experience.</p><br>
