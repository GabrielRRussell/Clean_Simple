		<h3>All about Me</h3>
		
		<p>I guess this page would be pretty barren normally, so an about me section fits it perfectly!</p>
		<p>Looking at what I've done in the past, my interests are particularly limited to a single field. Computer Science really encompasses most of what I enjoy doing. Looking at how a specific piece of hardware works, and then writing software for it, is my jam. I've delved into Web Design projects like this in the past, but nothing really complex. It just didn't pan out at all. But starting this class has allowed me to realize that while it seems hard to create something good looking and simplistic, it's much easier than it seems. This website started out without any CSS and me not knowing what I was doing. Now, after roughly two weeks of work, it has blossomed into something much more pretty than I could have imagined. I've actually had two offers to make websites for friends and mentors, but I feel like I should stay away from working for someone else until I feel like I can meet common demands easily. Telling someone I can make them a website, and then having to fall flat much later would make me pretty nervous. I can't stay in my shell though, and I want to work on bigger projects in the future.</p>
		<p>I was born in Joplin, Missouri, in 2001. I had a pretty simple life, going through school easily. In roughly 2013 my family moved to Myrtle Beach in South Carolina for a new job opportunity. It's been quite the adventure, moving from halfway across the United States, but I've grown to like it here. Part of me still misses Missouri though.</p>
