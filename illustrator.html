		<h1>Clean and Simple Illustrations</h1>
		
		<p>Here are some things that I made in Illustrator, for whoever wants to enjoy it. </p>
		
   		<h3>Mega Tyranitar Wallpaper</h3>
    	
    	<img src="images/mg_tyranitar_finished.png" width="1920" height="1080" alt="This was supposed to be a Mega Tyranitar, but there seems to be an error. Hold up." class = "pic"/> 

		<h3>Mewtwo Wallpaper</h3>
		
		<img src="images/mewtwo.png" width="1920" height="1080" alt="This was supposed to be a Mewtwo wallpaper, but there seems to be an error. Hold up." class = "pic"/>
		
		<h3>Ash Greninja Wallpaper</h3>
		<p>By far the hardest one to do, Ash Greninja had plenty of small pieces that I needed to put together for it to look visually pleasing.</p>
		
    	<img src="images/ash_greninja.png" width="8000" height="4507" alt="This was supposed to be an Ash Greninja wallpaper, but there seems to be an error. Hold up." class = "pic"/> 
    	
		<h3>Eevee Wallpaper</h3>
   	
   		<img src="images/eevee_finished.png" width="1250" height="700" alt="This was supposed to be an Eevee wallpaper, but there seems to be an error. Hold up." class = "pic"/> </main>
