These are the plans I have for the website in the future.

Mini-Blog: Weekly Mini-Blog on whatever topic I feel like at the last minute
About Me: A page about me. I guess I could combine this with the Contact page.
Cross-Platform Compatibillity: I want support on as many browsers as possible, so I'll be testing on various platforms.
Revamped Footer: Right now, the footer is kind of ugly. I want to revamp it right now.
Better Load Times: I'm going to focus on making the website as small as humanly possible after I finish it. Optimization comes last!
