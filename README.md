Clean and Simple Thoughts
Website for Web Design. Portfolio of types. 

I will be updating this over the next whenever as part of my Web Design Course's Major Project.

As of now (4/5/2017 at 7:01:15 EST), the website features some stuff.

1. 5 Pages. Home, Illustrations, Links, Contact, A Miniblog.
2. A game, where you find Hidden keys throughout the website.
3. A lot of badly optimised CSS
4. Seriously disgusting indentation (seriously, don't look at this unless you plan on fixing it yourself)
5. And a llama. Probably.

Aside from these amazing things, I don't really know. Have fun, it's hosted at kaisogen.github.io/Clean_Simple
